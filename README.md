# ðŸŽ¥ Sentiment Analysis and Academy Awards Prediction Using BERT

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project, **CineAI**, combines sentiment analysis and machine learning to predict the likelihood of movies winning Academy Awards. By analyzing user reviews, sentiment scores, movie metadata, and BERT embeddings of movie plots, we aim to build a robust predictive framework for award outcomes.
